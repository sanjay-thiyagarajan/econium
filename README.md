## :mechanical_arm: Inspiration

<p>Cars are a major contributor to air pollution producing significant amounts of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Nearly 80-90% of cars' environmental impact comes from fuel consumption and emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases.</p>

## :face_with_head_bandage: Effects
<ul>
  <li>Ozone layer depletion</li>
  <li>Lung infections</li>
  <li>Disabilities</li>
  <li>Noise and Air pollution</li>
 </ul>
 
## :bulb: Our Solution

<p> ECONIUM is an application that estimates gas emissions from vehicles using a machine learning approach. Each employee will receive a bonus based on their emission levels, which helps to reduce pollution to some extent and demonstrates the company's commitment towards the environment. </p>
