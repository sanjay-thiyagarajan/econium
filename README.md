## :mechanical_arm: Inspiration

<p>When talking about air pollution and its major contributors, cars are the first things that come to mind, producing significant amounts of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Nearly 80-90% of cars' environmental impact comes from fuel consumption and emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases.</p>

## :face_with_head_bandage: Effects
<ul>
  <li>Ozone layer depletion</li>
  <li>Lung infections</li>
  <li>Disabilities</li>
  <li>Noise and Air pollution</li>
 </ul>
 
## :bulb: Our Solution

<p> We help the businesses in encouraging their employees to minimize their use of high carbon-emitting vehicles for everyday travel. Our idea is to build a tool which helps companies in providing bonus pay to employees based on the carbon emission of their vehicles. So, when an employee emits very minimal amount of carbon, they will be provided with a higher bonus and the employee emitting higher amount of carbon will be getting a comparatively minimal bonus. This way we can ensure that both the employees and the company can actively participate in the fight against climate change. When considering the business perspective, the company will also be seen in a better light by the public, as it is doing something for the greater good of the world. </p>
