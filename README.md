## :mechanical_arm: Inspiration

<p>Cars are a major contributor to air pollution producing significant amounts of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Nearly 80-90% of cars' environmental impact comes from fuel consumption and emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases.</p>

## :face_with_head_bandage: Effects
<ul>
  <li>Ozone layer depletion</li>
